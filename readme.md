## SAO Releases Stalk

Personal project that allows to get people notified whenever an official selling site uploads a cover of a newly SAO release. Currently only supports Kadokawa.

tested with Python 3.9.5 on Windows 10.



## Usage
- Download the repository
- Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Launch the `sao-releases-stalk.py` file with your Command Prompt
- Wait until you get a notification

You may want to change the values of the URL [here](https://github.com/CeIest/SAO-Releases-Stalk/blob/main/sao-releases-stalk.py#L8), with the said release ID


## To-do list
- Get the hash of an empty file page somehow, and switch to that
- Add multiple websites at the same time
- Add mail support
- Support Bookwalker's preview detection (and launch my local ripping tool at the same time)
- Add an ""estimated"" waiting time
